        <p>We go here regularly. Good food but sometimes run out of items. Would prefer to know at 
          time you order not arrive and have to order something else. Breakfast and lunch both decent 
          menu items.</p>

        <p>Went at 4pm and managed to beat the rush. The waitress was super friendly and extremely 
          helpful. This was my first time coming and was able to check over the menu, order and walk out 
          the door in less than 10 mins! I got a cheeseburger +bacon side of fries and 6 boneless bbq 
          wings and wow! Juicy Burger and Tender wings melting in my mouth, I will definitely be going 
          back. Food smelled amazing on the ride home and tasted even better going down, nom nom nom. 
          Prices are good and they are definitely doing something right because this place is packed 
          every day on my way to work I. The morning so I just had to stop in and see what it was all 
          about. It's worth the drive if you don`t live close so definitely check them out.</p>
